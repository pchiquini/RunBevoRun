The issue persists with the leaderboard. Not all of the information is appearing on the board, despite being accessed.

Right now the leaderboard is accessed from the Menu button that appears after the Game Over. We will be changing this
for the final product.

For your testing purposes, I have the leaderboard accessible from the Main Menu by selecting the log off button.

The leaderboard files are found under Scenes/Leaderboard.

Thank you!
