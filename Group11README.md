## Grading Level: 
* Grading according to each members contribution on the BetaRelease.
* Same grade for all members

## Differences:
* There are not any differences between what was submitted for this release and what the App Idea Paper defined as being included in this release. In contrast, we were able to add functionalities that were intended for the final release but were implemented in this relaease in order to troubleshoot the application more realistics (Including 3 lives per run)

## Special Instructions:
* Game can only be played on landscape mode. 
* To make it easier for grading the girst Level is set to last about 25 seconds where most of the possible scenarios can be tested. The remaining levels (2,3,4) are only set to last 10 seconds each. This is intended to help the instructor navigate fully through out the whole game. For the final release, each level will last 25 seconds.
