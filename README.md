## Group 11 
 
### Patrizio Chiquini, Jacqueline Corona, Rachel Andrews
 
## Implementation Contributions:

Patrizio Chiquini: 35%
* Some of the UI
* SpriteKit Scene Editor
* Adding Physics to Bevo

Rachel Andrews:  35%
* Login Screen
* Trivia Question Screen

Jacqueline Corona: 30%
* UI Implementation (This includes: Bevo, object, background, scenes)
* Scoreboard Screen

## Grading Level: 
* Same Grade for all members

## Differences:
* The only difference include the Scoreboad screen implementation. The reason for this delayed release is the amount of work that it takes to keep up the data per user. In addition, having to learn SpriteKit for this project also delayed our understanding of how we could track a scoring system based on the Sprite Object, Bevo, hitting other objects, like tests, which would affect the final scoreboard.

## Special Instructions:
* None
